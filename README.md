# Thesis Proposal Template

This is a LaTeX template for thesis proposals in the Department
of Statistics at The University of British Columbia. The Department does
not have strict formatting requirements, so use of this template is optional,
but it is a convenient way to format your work.

This template was originally created by Alex Reinhart at Carnegie Mellon
University. It was modified by Daniel J. McDonald for use at UBC.

To use this template, you can either:

- Make a copy of this repository under your own GitHub account by pressing the
  green "Use this template" button. Then you can clone the repository to your
  computer and work in it like any other Git repository.
- In the Releases section on the GitHub page for this template, download a Zip
  file containing the template. You can work on these on your computer or upload
  them to Overleaf.

Once you have the template on your computer, open `proposal.tex` and follow the
instructions inside.
